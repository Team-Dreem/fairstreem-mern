`Conditions:`
The FairStreem brand name and logo are trademarked and protected by copyright, and may not be duplicated. However, the code FairStreem was originally built upon and that remains shared in this specific repository is open source. We encourage others to contribute in the effort to make the streaming industry more equitable and lucrative for the artists who enable it to profit and thrive. If more apps arise as a result of this project with that primary goal in mind, we believe the competition will only serve to help fulfill our intentions. All we ask is that you choose your own name, logo, and front-end design.
